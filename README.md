# effector-apollo

A lightweight wrapper around [Apollo Client](https://apollographql.com/docs/react) to interoperate with [‚òÑÔ∏è Effector](https://effector.dev/).
Create and manage your GraphQL Queries & Mutations _declaratively_, with Effector, while using powerful Apollo Client features, like normalized cache and Apollo Link.

## üîó Installation & use

```bash
$ npm install effector-apollo
# or
$ yarn add effector-apollo
# or
$ pnpm add effector-apollo
```

Note that this library requires `effector@23` and `@apollo/client` as peer dependencies, so make sure you have them installed in your project.

## API

### `createQuery`

Creates a new query that allows you to read data from GraphQL server or cache on request.

**Options:**

- `client`: `ApolloClient` that the query will use to fetch data
- `document`: `DocumentNode` describing your query
- `context`: `DefaultContext?` allows you to (optionally) provide arbitrary context to your Apollo Link

**Returns:** a new `Query` instance

### `Query`

**Commands:**

- `start`: `EventCallable<Variables>` unconditionally starts your query, and _will_ send a network request
- `refresh`: `EventCallable<Variables>` will refresh the query, using cache if possible
- `reset`: `EventCallable<void>` resets your query to its initial state

**Query state:**

- `$data`: `Store<Data | null>` containing your query data
- `$error`: `Store<ApolloError | null>` possibly containing query execution error
- `$status`: `Store<'initial' | 'pending' | 'done' | 'fail'>` reflecting current status of your query, which is also split into separate 'convenience' stores
  - `$idle`: `true` if the `Query` has not ever started
  - `$pending`: `true` if the `Query` is currently fetching
  - `$failed`: `true` if the `Query` has failed with some `ApolloError`
  - `$succeeded`: `true` if the `Query` has succeeded with data
  - `$finished`: `true` if the `Query` has finished with either success or failure

**Query state events:**

- `finished.success`: `Event<{ variables: Variables; meta: QueryMeta, data: Data }>` is fired when your `Query` succeeds, providing `variables` that you called the query with, and `data` that the query has returned
- `finished.failure`: `Event<{ variables: Variables; meta: QueryMeta, error: ApolloError }>` is fired when your `Query` fails, providing `variables` and the corresponding `error`
- `finished.finally`: `Event` is fired when your `Query` finishes with either `status: "done"` or `status: "fail"`, and will provide you with `data`/`error`

#### Example usage

```ts
const query = createQuery({
  client,
  document: gql`
    query user {
      user {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  `,
})

sample({
  clock: appStarted,
  target: query.start,
})
```

### `createMutation`

Creates a new mutation to modify data on your GraphQL server.

**Options:**

- `client`: `ApolloClient` that the mutation will use to fetch data
- `document`: `DocumentNode` describing your mutation
- `context`: `DefaultContext?` allows you to (optionally) provide arbitrary context to your Apollo Link

**Returns:** a new `Mutation` instance

### `Mutation`

**Commands:**

- `start`: `EventCallable<Variables>` unconditionally starts your `Mutation`, and _will_ send a network request immediately
- `reset`: `EventCallable<void>` resets your mutation to its initial state

**Mutation state:**

- `$status`: `Store<'initial' | 'pending' | 'done' | 'fail'>` reflecting current status of your `Mutation`, which is also split into separate 'convenience' stores
  - `$idle`: `true` if the `Mutation` has not ever started
  - `$pending`: `true` if the `Mutation` is currently fetching
  - `$failed`: `true` if the `Mutation` has failed with some `ApolloError`
  - `$succeeded`: `true` if the `Mutation` has succeeded with data
  - `$finished`: `true` if the `Mutation` has finished with either success or failure

**Mutation state events:**

- `finished.success`: `Event<{ variables: Variables; data: Data }>` is fired when your `Mutation` succeeds with `data` that the GraphQL server has returned
- `finished.failure`: `Event<{ variables: Variables; error: ApolloError }>` is fired when your `Mutation` fails with the corresponding execution `error`
- `finished.finally`: `Event` that's fired when your `Mutation` finishes with either `status: "done"` or `status: "fail"`, and will provide you with `data`/`error`

### `watchQuery`

`watchQuery` allows you to subscribe a particular query to Apollo Cache. By default, `Query` only reads data through a request, and does not read cache (unlike Apollo's React hooks).

This operator allows you to connect `Query` to cache if you expect other parts of your app to request the same query. This will help you avoid extra requests.

**Options:**

- `query`: `Query` that you want to subscribe to cache
- `client?`: `ApolloClient` to use cache from. Will use the client from `createQuery` if not provided
- `optimistic?`: `boolean` can be set to `false` to disable reading `optimistic` cache

### `optimistic`

`optimistic` helps you to define an optimistic response for your mutation. This will fill in data in Apollo Cache when running the mutation, so that UI is responsive. See more in Apollo Client "[Optimistic results](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/performance/optimistic-ui/)" documentation.

**Options:**

- `mutation`: `Mutation` that you want to define an optimistic response for
- `fn`: `Variables => Data` function that constructs an optimistic response for a mutation
- `client?`: `ApolloClient` to write response to. Will use the client from `createMutation` if not provided

## üí¨ Pick your library

When starting a new project from scratch, please, take a look at [Farfetched](https://farfetched.pages.dev/), a great data fetching tool, before using `effector-apollo`.

This library is an _interoperability_ layer for projects that already use Apollo Client. It makes your life easier by giving you access to your GraphQL data from Effector.

This library strives to keep its API similar to Farfetched so that your future migration to this tool is simpler.

## Releases policy

Versions `0.x.x` may contain breaking changes in minor releases, which will be documented.
